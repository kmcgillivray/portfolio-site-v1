		<h1>Standing Desk Report, Week 3</h1>
        <p class="date">March 12, 2014</p>
<div class="col-md-12"><p>A few months ago, my friend Foster told me that he predicted that soon everyone would be standing at their desks. I was definitely starting to notice a trend toward standing desks all over the Internet, myself. A few weeks ago I made the switch from a sitting desk to a desk set up that allows me to sit or stand at will and so far it has been a really positive change. If you’re curious about standing desks and are interested in trying it for yourself, or if this is the first time you’ve considered it, here’s why and how I did it and a few of my thoughts about the experience.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>The biggest reason I wanted to try a standing desk is that sometimes I would get tired of sitting while working and I would feel like standing but I couldn’t do that while using my desk the way it was. I think the general desire to stand came from the uncomfortableness of sitting for a long time and also because I like having a variety of environments to work in.</p>

<p>The other reason was that at the end of the day I would feel terrible after sitting all day with little activity. It just felt bad, and I think it’s important to listen to the intuitive signs your body sends you. The health benefits of standing desks have not been scientifically proven (that I know of), but I thought I would at least try it to see if I felt better and healthier subjectively. My theory was that sitting all day makes my energy levels drop because I’m using less energy and that if I could stand I would have more good chemicals going on in my brain and be more focused (spoiler: I was right).</p>

<p>It’s important to note that I wasn’t wanting to do it just to stand all day, or magically turn my sedentary lifestyle into an active one, or fix my posture. Whenever you hear the words “standing desk” it’s easy to assume that the point is to stand, but really the goal was to work in an environment where I could stand when I wanted to, sit when I wanted to, move around a little bit more and see if it would improve my overall mood and energy.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p>I followed this Ikea standing desk hack guide. I ordered the parts online since there isn’t an Ikea near where I am, so it cost around $50 with shipping. That also includes the extra side table that I may or may not add to my desk setup. This guide is nice because a standing desk from a manufacturer will be about $300-800 more expensive, although that could be worth it for an attractive desk that has a motorized height adjustment. If you’re interested in buying one, here’s a good guide.</p>

<p>So now my desk looks like this. Luckily, there was a tall, adjustable chair in the office that I could use, so whenever I want to sit I just raise it and sit down. Following advice from Foster, I typically sit as often as I used to stand. I used to get up for various reasons every hour for a little while, so now I sit for a little while at least once a hour and usually for a little longer in the afternoon or at the end of the day.</p>

<h2 id="what_its_been_like_so_far">What it’s been like so far</h2>

<p>I’ll start with the drawbacks. Yep, my feet get sore sometimes, and I could easily help that by getting a gel mat to stand on. At first there were a few other sore muscles, but after a few days of trying it at home a few hours a day before taking it into the office I didn’t have any more tired muscles. I definitely took a few days to get used to it.</p>

<p>I imagine there may also be some weird posture things going on that aren’t very good, but I think that’s going to be the case any time I’m staying in one spot for 8 hours unless I make a conscious effort to change it. I’d say moving from standing to sitting with bad posture is better than sitting the whole time with bad posture because as least you’re changing positions.</p>

<p>Otherwise it’s been an entirely enjoyable and positive change. I feel much less of the sitting-all-day blues when I’m done working for the day, I’m significantly more focused, productive, and alert throughout the day. I can’t prove that it’s a direct result of the standing desk, but I noticed it as soon as I switched. My painting teacher pointed out that standing must release more serotonin in the brain or something, and subjectively I think that’s probably true. It’s a good, energized feeling.</p>

<p>An unexpected but nice side effect is that it improves my conversation with my coworkers. Instead of awkwardly looking up and over my shoulder when they walk up to my desk to ask a question or talk to me about something I’m able to turn and talk to them directly and on the same level. This doesn’t make a huge difference, but I definitely feel like interactions are perceived as more positive and productive. I have no idea if they feel the same way, but I hope it improves the work environment for everyone, not just for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for following along on this experiment with me, and let me know if you try a standing desk yourself and what your experiences are.</p></div>
