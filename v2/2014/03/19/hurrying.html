		<h1>Hurrying</h1>
        <p class="date">March 19, 2014</p>
<div class="col-md-12"><p>I’ve been taking an oil painting class at a local art studio, and at one point during last week’s lesson my teacher said, “I want you to go faster than you’re comfortable with.”</p>

<p>Hurrying and rushing through a task is usually seen as a sign of stress and impatience—it’s what you do when you don’t enjoy what you’re doing and just want to be done with it. But sometimes going quickly isn’t a sign of impatience, it’s an important part of the creative process.</p>

<p>When my teacher said he wanted me to go quickly, it was for several reasons. He wanted to make sure I wasn’t thinking too much and second guessing what I was doing. If thoughts and hesitation are part of the work process, it breaks focus and the flow of activity from what’s considering what was just done to the action in response to that action. In any creative work, going more quickly than your thoughts will get you over and through any hesitation, doubt, and self-criticism and keep you focused on the single thing you’re doing.</p>

<p>He also wanted me to focus on the general picture rather than details. By going fast, it forces me to focus on getting a complete rough draft done because it’s too fast to work on anything specific. This is important because a creative work is a delicately balanced system in which the details and parts can’t really be determined except in relation to the whole. At first it’s good to see the entire thing at once so you can adjust everything as each individual part gradually becomes more refined. It keeps it flexible and changeable. If too much time goes into any one part, it’s not likely you’re going to change it later even if it needs to be changed because it took so long to do in the first place.</p>

<p>And he wanted me to feel uncomfortable. The only way to improve a skill or get better at something is to push yourself just beyond your comfort zone. Going at a slightly out of control speed challenged my practical painting abilities as well as my ability to let go of thoughts and focus on rough drafting.</p>

<p>Of course, not all creative work is fast. The fast work is balanced by a slower, more detail focused phase. But understanding the difference between impatient speed and speedy creative energy, and when it’s helpful, can help us avoid procrastination and carry out the creative process a little more smoothly.</p></div>
